How to use it?
* Put the folder on the root of C:\
* Then run as admin `New_User_No_DMP` for normal new users or `New_User_With_DMP` for new users that have acces to DMP.
* You can also run `Swap_No_DMP` for normal users or `Swap_With_DMP` for for users that have acces to DMP.
* After all the scripts you will still need to setup:
	* Login Zscaler

	* Acrobat Reader by default
And the PC is ready for swap enjoy your free time. :)
